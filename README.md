# t-motion-detector-cli
A cli tool (dashboard) to monitor your Environment, Motion sensors and Notifiers.
It has been repurposed from the original intent because I didn't see the need to
create an explicit cli tool either then what the t-motion-detector tool will
provide, via the npm run-script command.
This tool will have a second portion of functionality which allows to record user
stories, with the intent of saving these for later reuse (WIP)

* v 0.1.2: Removed user story unit tests  (not relevant for this project).
* v 0.1.1: Building first unit tests, first express welcome message;
* v 0.1.0: First version, draft for first tests and package file;
