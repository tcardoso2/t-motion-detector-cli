# t-motion-detector-cli
A cli tool (dashboard) to monitor your Environment, Motion sensors and Notifiers.
It has been repurposed from the original intent because I didn't see the need to
create an explicit cli tool either then what the t-motion-detector tool will
provide, via the npm run-script command.
